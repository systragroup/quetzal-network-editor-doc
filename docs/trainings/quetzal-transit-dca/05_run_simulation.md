## Run a simulation
Once the parameters are set, you can run a simulation with the **RUN SIMULATION** button. The interface will provide a update of the simulation process in real time. Once a step is succesfully completed, it turns green.

Once the simulation is complete, you can access the outputs in the dedicated tabs. You can also check the logs with the **LOGS** menue, it offers two options **SHOW** to read them directly in the interface and **DOWNLOAD**. The logs of each step are displayed in scrollable windows.
