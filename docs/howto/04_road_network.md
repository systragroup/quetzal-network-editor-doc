::: tip :cloud: TIP
You can create a group field in your road links that you can modify when you multiple select road links on the map. This will allow you to easily identify the links you edited group by group and later filter the links by group and edit them again.

:::

To select many several road links at the same time, hold shift and click on all the road links
